## Project

**What is the goal?**

Our goal is to create a web application that will help families with children.

**What are the problems it will solve?**

Child support is a real problem these days. And the clothes and toys that were purchased recently are no longer suitable for the baby. 
Most families get rid of such things by recycling, not thinking that these things can be useful to another family. 
Our goal is to create a platform where families can give away old things for a child and receive new ones in return from other similar families.
And also to create a fund for families who are going through hard times.

**What is the vision?**

Our site will save many families from the problems of where to put old unnecessary children's things, and where, in turn, to get others that will suit the child. The system of the lot on a competitive basis will divide the ads according to the age of the child for which the item is suitable.

## Alternatives / Market research

**What apps do something similar?**

https://olx.kz 
This site has a section for children's things.

**What apps are content adjacent?**

https://asar-fond.kz This fund helps disadvantaged families and 
conducts regular collections on the social network - instagram

**What unrelated apps are structural models?**

https://detiangeli.kz This fund helps children with serious illnesses. 
We took a similar model structure - donation.

## Goals
- Our main goal is to develop a circulation by creating an anti auction of children's stuff so that families can save money
- We want to create a fund to help families in difficult situations. 
- Our web application solves different problems. From a voluntary payment system and closing fundraising (with a report), to bulletin board posting. With lots function. 
- Our product solves different pains and problems of the potential audience. 
- Our concept will help improve the current process, because there are no analogues other than (charitable foundations). 

## Technologies
In our project we use :

1. Backend : ASP.NET CORE 

2. ORM : Entity Framework Core 

3. Database: MSSQL 

4. Frontend : html , css, javascript , bootstrap 

5. UX/UI : Figma

 
Description of technologies:

1.The ASP.NET Core platform is a technology from Microsoft designed to create various kinds of web applications: from small websites to large web portals and web services.

2.The Entity Framework introduces Microsoft's object-relational mapping (ORM) technology for data access. Entity Framework Core allows you to abstract from the database itself and its tables and work with data as objects of a class, regardless of the type of storage. If at the physical level we operate with tables, indexes, primary and foreign keys, but at the conceptual level that Entity Framework offers us, we are already working with objects.

3.Microsoft SQL Server is a relational database management system developed by Microsoft. As a database server, it is a software product with the primary function of storing and retrieving data as requested by other software applicationsâ€”which may run either on the same computer or on another computer across a network (including the Internet). Microsoft markets at least a dozen different editions of Microsoft SQL Server, aimed at different audiences and for workloads ranging from small single-machine applications to large Internet-facing applications with many concurrent users.

4.A front-end web developer is responsible for implementing visual and interactive elements that users engage with through their web browser when using a web application. They are usually supported by back-end web developers, who are responsible for server-side application logic and integration of the work front-end developers do.

5.Figma is a cross-platform online graphic editor for collaborative work. The program allows you to create wireframes, UIs, prototypes, presentations and easily transfer materials into development. In online mode, you can observe the work process, leave comments and discuss the layout.

## Non-Functional requirements
- The backend must be created using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture pattern
- Entity Framework Core technology must be used to access the databases.
- The website must work in all modern browsers
- The website must have a donation system
- The website must be maintained, stable, testable and documented
- There should be transparent data processing, and a guarantee that personal information will not get to third parties.

## Risks
- The registration process can take some time, and bring some inconvenience to much-needed users.
- There is a risk of registering people who profit from other people's misfortunes 
- The risk is the difficulty of using the website by uneducated as well as elderly people.
